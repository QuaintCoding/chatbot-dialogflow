## Hansung Chatbot
Recently, non-face-to-face classes have been held due to COVID-19.

Before COVID-19, students were able to learn a lot of information through seniors and colleagues.

In 2021, students can only know school information through the school website.

Therefore, We thought about how to get information on the school website easily and conveniently, and we build hansung chatbot.

## Goals
Provide information to Hansung University students more easily, quickly, and conveniently, and to create a prototype of an official chatbot that can be transplanted onto the actual school website.

## Description
This project is a chatbot service based on Hansung University homepage.
The chatbot engine uses Google dialogflow to analyze, extract and understand meaningful information from text through Natural Language Processing (NLP).
We use React(create react app) base for Client and Server, the dialogflow API handles the response of the chatbot to the user's input.
To make a chatbot, we referred to the video below.
